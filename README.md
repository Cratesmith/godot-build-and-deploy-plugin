# godot-build-and-deploy-plugin

### please note:

the build portion of the plugin is redundant as it does the same thing as the export all button that is already part of the engine, and the build menu will be depreciated

### setup

just place the build-and-deploy file into your addons folder and enable the plugin

you will need butler installed (and added to path if on windows)

to use this plugin you will need to create a new file to contain your builds and create files in it like shown:
