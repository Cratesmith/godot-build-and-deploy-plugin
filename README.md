# godot-build-and-deploy-plugin

### please note:

the build portion of the plugin is redundant as it does the same thing as the export all button that is already part of the editor, and so the build menu will be depreciated

### setup

you can download the build and deploy file on it's own from itch [here](https://figroot.itch.io/godot-build-and-deploy)

just place the build-and-deploy file into your addons folder and enable the plugin

you will need butler installed (and added to path if on windows)

once the plugin is enabled and butler is ready there is a complete guide in the about tab of the plugin which will walk you through the setup and usage of the plugin
