# godot-build-and-deploy-plugin

### please note:

the build portion of the plugin is redundant as it does the same thing as the export all button that is already part of the editor, and so the build menu will be depreciated

### setup

this plugin is available on the asset library [here](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1103)

you will need butler installed (and added to path if on windows) which you can get from itch [here](https://itchio.itch.io/butler)

once the plugin is installed, enabled, and butler is ready, there is a complete guide in the about tab of the plugin which will walk you through the setup and usage of the plugin
